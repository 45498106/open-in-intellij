# open-in-intellij
This is an extension for Google Chrome to open resources from the Dev Tools (like CSS, SCSS, JS files) directly inside your IntelliJ IDE (WebStorm, PHPStorm etc.)

This extension uses the IntelliJ REST API: http://develar.org/idea-rest-api/

In order for the link opening to work, you might have to go into your WebStorm/PHPStorm Settings ->Build,Execution,Deployment -> Built-In Server and check the box "Allow unsigned requests".

## Installation
Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store:
